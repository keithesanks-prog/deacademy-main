Welcome to the lesson on WHERE versus HAVING Examples.

Let's look at the three most common scenarios for each.

First, when to use WHERE.
Use WHERE when you are asking a question about the raw data in a specific row.

Example 1: Dates.
"Show me orders from 2023."
Syntax: WHERE order_date greater than or equal to '2023-01-01'.

Example 2: Status.
"Show me only active customers."
Syntax: WHERE status equals 'Active'.

Example 3: Text patterns.
"Show me names starting with A."
Syntax: WHERE name LIKE 'A%'.

Notice that none of these require counting or summing anything. You can look at one single row and say "Yes" or "No".

Now, when to use HAVING.
Use HAVING when you are asking a question about a calculated summary of a group.

Example 1: Counts.
"Show me customers who placed more than 5 orders."
Syntax: GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(*) greater than 5.

Example 2: Sums.
"Show me sales reps who sold more than 10,000 dollars."
Syntax: GROUP BY rep_id HAVING SUM(sales_amount) greater than 10,000.

Example 3: Averages.
"Show me products with an average rating below 3 stars."
Syntax: GROUP BY product_id HAVING AVG(rating) less than 3.

Finally, the Power Move: Using BOTH.
"Show me customers from the USA who placed more than 5 orders."

First, filter the rows: WHERE country equals 'USA'.
Then, group them: GROUP BY customer_id.
Then, filter the groups: HAVING COUNT(*) greater than 5.

Remember: Filter rows early with WHERE. Filter groups late with HAVING.
