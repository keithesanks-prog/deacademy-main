Welcome to the lesson on LIMIT and OFFSET in SQL.

The LIMIT clause controls how many rows are returned by a query. It's essential for working with large datasets.

The basic syntax is: SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT number.

For example, SELECT star FROM products LIMIT 5, returns only the first 5 products.

LIMIT is most powerful when combined with ORDER BY.

To get the top 3 most expensive products, you would write:
SELECT product name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 3.

This sorts by price from highest to lowest, then takes only the first 3 rows.

Now let's talk about OFFSET.

OFFSET skips a certain number of rows before returning results.

The syntax is: SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT number OFFSET skip.

For example, SELECT star FROM customers LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10, skips the first 10 rows, then returns the next 5 rows. This gives you rows 11 through 15.

OFFSET is commonly used for pagination. If you want page 2 of results with 10 items per page, you would write: LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10.

Page 3 would be: LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20.

The formula is: LIMIT page size OFFSET, open parenthesis, page number minus 1, close parenthesis, times page size.

Here's a powerful pattern: finding the Nth highest value.

To find the 3rd highest salary, you write:
SELECT first name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2.

This sorts salaries from highest to lowest, skips the first 2 rows, which are the 1st and 2nd highest, then returns 1 row, which is the 3rd highest.

The pattern for Nth highest is: ORDER BY column DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET, open parenthesis, N minus 1, close parenthesis.

Important tip: Always use ORDER BY with LIMIT. Without it, the results are unpredictable and may change between queries.

Remember: LIMIT controls how many rows. OFFSET controls where to start. Together, they give you precise control over your result set.
