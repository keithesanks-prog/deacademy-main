Welcome to the lesson on SQL Date Arithmetic across different databases.

The problem is this: Different SQL databases use different syntax for the same operations.
This can be very confusing when you are learning from tutorials that use SQL Server syntax, but your platform uses MySQL.

Let's cover the three most common operations: Adding days, Subtracting days, and Finding the difference between dates.

Operation 1: Adding Days.

In MySQL, you write: DATE_ADD, then the date, then INTERVAL 7 DAY.
In SQL Server, you write: DATEADD, then the word "day", then the number 7, then the date.
In PostgreSQL, you write: the date, then a plus sign, then INTERVAL '7 days' in quotes.

Notice the differences.
MySQL puts the date first and uses the keyword INTERVAL.
SQL Server puts the date last and does NOT use the keyword INTERVAL.
PostgreSQL uses a plus sign like regular math.

Operation 2: Subtracting Days.

In MySQL, you write: DATE_SUB, then the date, then INTERVAL 3 DAY.
In SQL Server, you write: DATEADD, then the word "day", then NEGATIVE 3, then the date.
In PostgreSQL, you write: the date, then a minus sign, then INTERVAL '3 days'.

Notice that SQL Server does not have a separate "subtract" function. You just use DATEADD with a negative number.

Operation 3: Finding the Difference.

In MySQL, you write: DATEDIFF, then the end date, then the start date.
In SQL Server, you write: DATEDIFF, then the word "day", then the start date, then the end date.
In PostgreSQL, you just subtract the two dates like regular math.

The key differences to remember:
1. Argument order is different. MySQL puts the date first. SQL Server puts the date last.
2. The INTERVAL keyword. MySQL uses it. SQL Server does not.
3. DATEDIFF argument order. MySQL is end minus start. SQL Server is start then end.

Here is a memory trick.
MySQL: Think "Date function, then INTERVAL".
SQL Server: Think "The unit is in the function name".
PostgreSQL: Think "Just use math operators".

End of lesson.
