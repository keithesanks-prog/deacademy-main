Welcome to the "One Step at a Time" Drill.

This lesson is different. We are not going to write a full query.
We are going to practice the art of stopping.

I am going to give you a complex problem.
Your instinct will be to start writing "SELECT".
I want you to fight that instinct.
Do not write SELECT. Do not write FROM.

Here is the problem:
"Calculate the total revenue for Electronics products sold in Q4 2023, but only for stores that had more than 50 transactions."

Stop. Take a breath.

Step 1: The Entity.
Ask yourself: "What does one row in my final output represent?"
Is it a Product? A Date? A Store?
...
The answer is: A Store.
We want revenue FOR stores.
So, write down: GROUP BY Store ID.
That is it. Do not do anything else.

Step 2: The Filters.
Ask yourself: "Which rows are trash?"
Look at the raw data.
We only want "Electronics". We only want "Q4 2023".
So, write down: WHERE Category is Electronics AND Date is between Oct 1 and Dec 31.
These are row filters. They happen before we even look at the revenue.

Step 3: The Aggregates.
Now, and only now, do we look at the math.
We need "Total Revenue". That is SUM(Revenue).
We need "More than 50 transactions". That is COUNT(*) > 50.
Since this is a filter on a calculated number, it goes in HAVING.

So, we have three pieces of paper:
1. GROUP BY Store.
2. WHERE Electronics and Q4.
3. HAVING Count > 50.

Now, you can put them together.
SELECT Store, SUM(Revenue)
FROM Sales
WHERE Category = 'Electronics' AND Date BETWEEN '2023-10-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY Store
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50.

See? You didn't solve it all at once. You solved three tiny problems.
And three tiny problems are much less scary than one big one.

End of lesson.
