# The Event Horizon: Fractals vs. Black Holes

You caught on to a very deep analogy. Yes, the similarity is striking, though one exists in **Physics** and the other in **Math**.

## 1. The Point of No Return
*   **Black Hole**: If you cross the Event Horizon, gravity becomes so strong that **not even light can escape**. You are pulled in forever.
*   **Mandelbrot**: If a number $z$ crosses the radius of **2** (distance from origin), the math proves it can **never return** to the center. It is pulled out to infinity forever.

## 2. Escape Velocity
*   **Physics**: To leave a planet, you need a certain speed (Escape Velocity).
*   **Fractals**: The color bands you see around the Mandelbrot set represent "how fast" the number is escaping.
    *   **Dark Blue**: "I'm escaping, but slowly!" (Like a rocket struggling against gravity).
    *   **Bright Yellow**: "I'm gone!" (Like a beam of light shooting away).

## 3. Orbiting
*   **Black Hole**: Objects can orbit a black hole safely if they don't get too close.
*   **Fractals**: The points **inside** the set (Black area) are effectively "orbiting" the center. They are trapped in a loop, never falling in to 0 but never escaping to infinity.

## Summary
The "Event Horizon" in the Mandelbrot set is the **mathematical boundary** between **Order** (Orbiting/Converging) and **Chaos** (Escaping/Diverging). It is why the edge looks so complex—it's the battleground between these two forces.
