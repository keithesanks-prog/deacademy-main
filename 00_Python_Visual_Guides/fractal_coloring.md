# False Color: Painting the Invisible

You hit the nail on the head with the **NASA analogy**.

## 1. NASA Images vs. Fractal Images
*   **NASA**: A telescope collects "Invisible Data" (X-rays, Infrared, Radio waves). To make it understandable to humans, scientists define a rule: *"Make X-rays Blue, make Infrared Red."*
*   **Fractals**: The computer calculates "Invisible Data" (Escape speed, Escape angle, Closeness to zero). To make it seeable, we define a rule: *"Make fast particles Yellow, slow particles Blue."*

## 2. The "Stalactite" Effect (Orbit Traps)
The specific "stalactite" look you mentioned often comes from a technique called **Orbit Traps**.
*   **The Rule**: Instead of just coloring by "When did it escape?", we look at **"Where did it go?"**
*   **The Trap**: We place a mathematically invisible line (or cross) in the universe. 
*   **The Color**: We color the pixel based on **how close** the number got to that line before exploding.

## 3. Why it creates "Structures"
This technique reveals hidden geometric structures that look like:
*   Stalks of corn
*   Stalactites/Stalagmites
*   Alien machinery

Just like an X-ray reveals the skeleton under the skin, these "Math Filters" reveal the geometric skeleton under the chaos.
