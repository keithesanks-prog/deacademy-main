- **Day 4:** Practice with `learning_path_crawl_walk_run.md` CRAWL questions
- **Day 5:** Use `speaking_guide_connecting_concepts.md` - practice explaining out loud
- **Day 6-7:** Review and repeat

**Success Check:** Can you explain OLTP vs OLAP? ETL vs ELT? Lake vs Warehouse?

---

### Week 2: Connections (WALK)
**Goal:** Understand how components work together

**Daily Plan:**
- **Day 1-2:** Read HTML guide 🚶 WALK tabs (Warehouse Layers, Architecture, Pipeline)
- **Day 3:** Study `system_architecture_visual.md` - see complete flow
- **Day 4:** Practice with `learning_path_crawl_walk_run.md` WALK questions
- **Day 5:** Use `speaking_guide_connecting_concepts.md` - practice complete pipeline explanation
- **Day 6:** Draw the pipeline yourself from memory
- **Day 7:** Review and repeat

**Success Check:** Can you draw the Bronze→Silver→Gold flow? Explain how data gets from source to BI tool?

---

### Week 3: Mastery (RUN)
**Goal:** Design systems and speak confidently

**Daily Plan:**
- **Day 1-2:** Read HTML guide 🏃 RUN tabs (Metrics, Terminology)
- **Day 3:** Practice with `learning_path_crawl_walk_run.md` RUN questions

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Take Notes in the HTML Guide**
While the HTML doesn't have built-in notes, you can:
- Keep a separate notebook open
- Use the markdown files to add your own notes
- Create a `my_notes.md` file in `06_Data_Modeling`

### 2. **Draw Diagrams**
Visual learning is powerful:
- Draw the pipeline on paper
- Draw star schemas
- Draw how components connect
- Use the ASCII diagrams as templates

### 3. **Practice Out Loud**
Reading ≠ Speaking:
- Explain concepts to yourself
- Record yourself
- Teach someone else
- Use the exact phrases from `speaking_guide_connecting_concepts.md`

### 4. **Use the "So What?" Test**
After every concept:
- "So what? Why does this matter?"
- Connect technical to business value
- Example: "Star schema makes queries 10x faster, enabling self-service analytics"

### 5. **Connect Everything**
Use `visual_connections_guide.md` to:
- Understand where each piece fits
- See micro (individual tables) to macro (complete pipeline)
- Know where queries actually run
